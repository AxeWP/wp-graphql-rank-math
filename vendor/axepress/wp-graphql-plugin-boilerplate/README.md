# WPGraphQL Plugin Boilerplate

ðŸš¨ NOTE: This is prerelease software. Use at your own risk ðŸš¨

A boilerplate for creating WPGraphQL extensions. Can be used as a Composer dependency or as a tool to scaffold your own plugin.

* [Join the WPGraphQL community on Slack.](https://join.slack.com/t/wp-graphql/shared_invite/zt-3vloo60z-PpJV2PFIwEathWDOxCTTLA)

Inspired by the following projects and their contributors:

* [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql)
* [WPGraphQL BuddyPress](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-buddypress)
* [WPGraphQL for GravityForms](https://github.com/harness-software/wp-graphql-gravity-forms)
* [WPGraphQL for WooCommerce](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce)

## Features

* Default folder structure that mirrors WPGraphQL.
* Helper classes, interfaces, methods, and traits to make it easier to register new GraphQL types.
* Dependency management with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
* Code sniffing with [PHPCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer), [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/), and [Automattic's WordPress VIP Coding Standards](https://github.com/Automattic/VIP-Coding-Standards)
* Static Analysis with [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/)
* WPUnit Testing with [Codeception](http://codeception.com/) and [WPBrowser](https://wpbrowser.wptestkit.dev/).
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image generation.
* Automated CI with [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## System Requirements

* PHP 7.4+ | 8.0
* WordPress 5.4.1+
* WPGraphQL 1.8.0+

## Getting Started

### As a Composer dependency
```console
composer require axepress/wp-graphql-plugin-boilerplate
```

### As a plugin starter

#### 1. Initialize the plugin

Creating your WPGraphQL plugin is as simple as downloading the project to your machine and running `curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/AxeWP/wp-graphql-plugin-boilerplate/master/bin/install.sh | bash`.

You will be asked to provide the following configuration details, or you can pass them as flags.

* **Branch (`--branch`)** : The Github branch to use as the source.
* **Name (`--name`)** : The name of your plugin (e.g. `My Plugin for WPGraphQL`).
* **Namespace (`--namespace`)**: The PHP namespace to be used for the plugin (e.g. `MyPlugin`).
* **Path (`--path`)**: The path to the directory directory where the plugin should be created (e.g. `mysite/wp-content/plugins`).
* **Prefix (`--prefix`)**: The plugin prefix (in snake case). This will be used to generate unique functions, hooks and constants (e.g. `my_plugin`).
* **Slug (`--slug`)**: The slug (in kebab-case) to use for the plugin (e.g. `wp-graphql-my-plugin`).

Alternatively, you can download the repository and run `composer create-plugin`.

#### 2. Create your `.env` file

Rename `.env.dist` to `.env`, and set the variables to your particular localhost/testing environment.
