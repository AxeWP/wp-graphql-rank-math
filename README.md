## Updating and Versioning

As we work towards a 1.0 Release, we will need to introduce **numerous** breaking changes. We will do our best to group multiple breaking changes together in a single release, to make it easier on developers to keep their projects up-to-date.

Until we hit v1.0, we're using a modified version of [SemVer](https://semver.org/), where:

* v0.**x**: "Major" releases. These releases introduce new features, and _may_ contain breaking changes to either the PHP API or the GraphQL schema
* v0.x.**y**: "Minor" releases. These releases introduce new features and enhancements and address bugs. They _do not_ contain breaking changes.
* v0.x.y.**z**: "Patch" releases. These releases are reserved for addressing issue with the previous release only.
